Random-position-of-input
========================

1) Develop and design a web application that will allow user to enter any input string up to 255 characters. 
2) Input field should be cleared after user hits enter.
3) String that user entered should be displayed at any random position on the page with random font size and font type.
4) String position should not overlap with position of the previous entries and should not overlap with the input field.
